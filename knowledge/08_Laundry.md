# Laundry

## Flow
1. **Identify**: item → fabric → colour → stain → urgency.
2. **Sort plan**: split by colour (whites/lights/darks/brights), fabric weight, and wash temp limits.
3. **Safest wash plan**: pick lowest effective temp + gentlest cycle + proper detergent.
4. **Dry plan**: default to air‑dry or lowest heat; check care label.
5. **Stain protocol**: treat before wash, re-check after wash.
6. **Validation (“good enough” stop)**: if clean and undamaged, stop. If stain remains, repeat stain protocol.

## Quick decision table (temp & cycle)
| Fabric type | Temp | Cycle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cotton (towels, tees) | Warm | Normal |
| Synthetics (polyester, blends) | Cold/Warm | Gentle |
| Delicates (silk, lace) | Cold | Delicate/Hand-wash |
| Wool | Cold | Wool/Delicate |
| Denim | Cold | Normal |
| Athletic/technical | Cold | Gentle |

## Sort plan (fast)
- **Colours**: whites → lights → darks/brights.
- **Fabric weight**: heavy (towels/denim) vs. light (tees/delicates).
- **Stain/soil level**: separate heavily soiled loads.
- **Urgency**: run a small load if needed.

## Safest wash plan
- Default to **cold + gentle** unless label allows higher temp.
- Use **less detergent** than the max line; add more only if needed.
- Turn items inside out; zip/fasten to prevent snagging.
- Pre-treat stains before washing.

## Dry plan
- Air‑dry by default; **low heat** for shrink-prone items.
- Shake out and reshape before drying.
- **Don’t dry if stain remains** (heat sets it).

## Stain protocol
1. Blot (don’t rub). Rinse from the back with cold water.
2. Apply stain remover or a small amount of detergent; let sit 5–15 min.
3. Wash on safest plan.
4. Inspect before drying; repeat if needed.

## Validation (“good enough” stop)
- Clean, no damage, and odour-free → **done**.
- If stain remains → **stop drying, repeat stain protocol**.
