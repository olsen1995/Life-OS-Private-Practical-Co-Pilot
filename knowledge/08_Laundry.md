# 08 — Laundry (Austin) — Practical Rules + Recipes (Amana Top-Load)

Purpose:
A practical, repeatable laundry playbook that matches Austin’s real washer settings and common real-life laundry problems (towels, bedding, smoke yellowing, baby stains, work grease). Defaults to least-risk, label-respecting choices.

Washer context (Austin):
Top-load Amana with water-level options:
- Auto Sensing
- Auto Sensing + Extra Rinse
- Deep Water Wash
- Deep Water Wash + Extra Rinse

Temps:
- Tap Cold / Cold / Cool / Warm / Hot

Cycles:
- Heavy / Bulky Items & Sheets / Regular / Casual / Delicate / Drain & Spin / Clean Washer / Rinse & Spin

---

## Safety Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1) Never mix bleach with:
- vinegar
- ammonia
- toilet bowl cleaners
- random bathroom cleaners
Mixing can create toxic gases.

2) Do not mix bleach and peroxide.

3) One chemical strategy per load.
If you used vinegar/peroxide and plan bleach later:
- run an empty Rinse & Spin first.

4) If stains remain after washing:
- do NOT machine-dry on heat (heat sets stains).

---

## Flow (Core)
1) **Identify**: item → fabric → colour → stain/odour → urgency.
2) **Sort plan**: split by colour (whites/lights/darks/brights), fabric weight, and wash temp limits.
3) **Safest wash plan**: lowest effective temp + gentlest cycle + correct detergent amount.
4) **Dry plan**: default to air-dry or lowest heat; check care label.
5) **Stain protocol**: treat before wash, re-check after wash.
6) **Validation (“good enough” stop)**: if clean and undamaged, stop. If stain remains, repeat stain protocol.

---

## 60-Second Decision (Quick)

1) What is it?
- Whites / Colours / Towels / Bedding / Delicates / Work clothes / “Stained item”

2) Is it bulky (bedding/blanket)?
- Yes → Bulky Items & Sheets + Deep Water Wash

3) Does it have odour/residue/sensitive-skin concerns?
- Yes → choose “+ Extra Rinse”

4) Pick temp:
- Colours: Cold/Cool
- Towels: Warm (Hot only if whites + heavy soil)
- Bedding: Warm (Cold for coloured)
- Delicates: Cold
- Stains unknown: Cold/Cool first (safer)

---

## 5-Minute Decision (Normal)

### Step 1 — Sort
- Whites
- Dark colours
- Towels
- Bedding
- Delicates
- Stain/problem items

### Step 2 — Choose a washer recipe
Use the recipes below.

### Step 3 — Drying rule
- If stains remain: air dry and repeat treatment.
- If clean: dry per label (low/normal).

---

## Quick decision table (temp & cycle)
| Fabric type | Temp | Cycle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cotton (towels, tees) | Warm | Regular (Heavy if very soiled) |
| Synthetics (polyester, blends) | Cold/Cool | Casual or Delicate |
| Delicates (lace, thin knits) | Cold | Delicate |
| Wool | Cold | Delicate |
| Denim | Cold/Cool | Regular |
| Athletic/technical | Cold | Casual/Delicate |

Note: Always follow the care label if it conflicts.

---

## Sort plan (fast)
- **Colours**: whites → lights → darks/brights.
- **Fabric weight**: heavy (towels/denim) vs. light (tees/delicates).
- **Stain/soil level**: separate heavily soiled loads.
- **Urgency**: run a small load if needed.

---

## Safest wash plan
- Default to **cold/cool + gentler cycle** unless label allows higher temp and soil demands it.
- Use **less detergent** than the max line; add more only if needed.
- Turn items inside out; zip/fasten to prevent snagging.
- Pre-treat stains before washing.

---

## Dry plan
- Air-dry by default; **low heat** for shrink-prone items.
- Shake out and reshape before drying.
- **Don’t dry if stain remains** (heat sets it).

---

## Washer Recipes (Austin’s Amana)

### Towels (cleaner, less musty)
- Cycle: Regular (Heavy if very dirty)
- Temp: Warm (Hot only for white towels and heavy soil)
- Water: Deep Water Wash
- Rinse: Deep Water Wash + Extra Rinse (recommended)
Notes:
- Skip fabric softener if towels feel less absorbent.

### Bedding (sheets, pillowcases)
- Cycle: Bulky Items & Sheets
- Temp: Warm (Cold/Cool for coloured bedding)
- Water: Deep Water Wash
- Rinse: + Extra Rinse if sensitive skin or detergent residue
Notes:
- Don’t overload—sheets need room to move.

### Whites (everyday whites)
- Cycle: Regular
- Temp: Warm (Hot only if label allows + heavy soil)
- Water: Auto Sensing (Deep Water if large load)
Notes:
- If whitening is needed, pick ONE method (don’t mix chemicals).

### Colours (everyday)
- Cycle: Regular or Casual
- Temp: Cold/Cool
- Water: Auto Sensing
Notes:
- Cold protects colour and reduces shrinking.

### Delicates
- Cycle: Delicate
- Temp: Cold
- Water: Auto Sensing
Notes:
- Avoid heavy agitation and high heat drying.

## Stain Protocol (General)
1) Blot (don’t rub). Rinse from the back with cold water.
2) Apply a small amount of detergent or stain remover; let sit 5–15 min.
3) Wash using the safest plan.
4) Inspect before drying; repeat if needed.

---

## Common Problems (Practical Playbook)

### 1) Yellow smoke staining / nicotine film (fabric)
Least-risk path:
1) Pre-soak warm water + a bit of detergent (30–60 min).
2) Wash: Regular + Warm + Extra Rinse.
3) Air-dry check.
Escalation (whites only if label allows):
- Bleach can work, but measure carefully and never combine with vinegar/peroxide.

### 2) Baby blowout / poop stains
- Rinse immediately with cold water (from back of fabric).
- Pre-treat with detergent.
- Wash: Regular + Cold/Cool.
- Air-dry check before dryer.

### 3) Grease/oil (work clothes)
- Pre-treat directly with dish soap (small amount), gently work in.
- Wash: Regular/Heavy + Warm.
- Air-dry check.

### 4) Odours (musty/sweat)
- Choose + Extra Rinse.
- Don’t let wet laundry sit.
- If washer smells: run Clean Washer cycle.

---

## Washer Maintenance (Keeps clothes cleaner)

### Clean Washer (monthly or when smell appears)
- Run Clean Washer cycle as directed by machine.
- Wipe edges/under lid area.
- Leave lid open after loads to dry out.

---

## Validation (“good enough” stop)
- Clean, no damage, odour-free → done.
- If stain remains → stop heat drying, repeat stain protocol.

---

## Assistant Output Rules (How to respond)
Ask at most 2 clarifying questions:
1) Whites or colours?
2) Any stains/odour and what kind?

Then provide:
- Cycle + Temp + Water level + (Extra Rinse yes/no)
- One stain step (if relevant)
- One safety warning only if relevant (bleach/peroxide/vinegar mixing, heat-setting stains)
