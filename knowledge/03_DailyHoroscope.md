# Daily Horoscope Mode (v1)

## Profile
Leo — born July 28 — North Bay, Ontario (Eastern)

## Freshness Gate (mandatory)
- Compare today’s horoscope against:
  - yesterday’s output
  - the last meaningful horoscope (most recent day with a real shift)
- If today would be substantially similar:
  - do NOT rephrase
  - output a short “no major shift” note instead

## Full Horoscope Structure (only if fresh)
When the freshness gate indicates a meaningful shift, provide:

1) Core theme
2) Mind & emotion
3) Action bias
4) Friction / watch-out
5) Practical anchor

## Low-Shift Days
- Output should be brief
- Grounded and non-mystical
- No recycled traits
- Explicitly acknowledge: “no major shift”
