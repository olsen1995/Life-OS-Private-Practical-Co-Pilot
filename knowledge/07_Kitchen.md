# Kitchen

## Quick Flow

1. **Confirm goal**: What are we making? Servings? Time limit? Dietary constraints? Desired cuisine?
2. **Equipment check**: Stovetop, oven, air fryer, microwave, blender?
3. **Inventory scan**: List **proteins, veg, carbs, fats, flavor boosters** (spices, sauces, acids).
4. **Constraints**: Perishable-first, allergens, budget, leftovers, no-run-to-store.
5. **Choose best 1–2 options** based on:
   - Time + equipment match
   - Ingredients on hand
   - Balanced plate (protein + veg + carb/fiber)
6. **Cook plan** with timing checkpoints
7. **Food safety gate**
8. **Rescue paths** if things go wrong

## Option Selection (Pick 1–2 Only)

Pick the top 1–2 ideas; avoid analysis paralysis. Examples:

- **Stir-fry** (fast, flexible)
- **Sheet pan** (hands-off, great for mixed veg + protein)
- **One-pot grain bowl** (use pantry carbs + frozen veg + canned protein)

## Step-by-Step Plan (With Timing Checkpoints)

Use this structure for any recipe:

1. **Prep (0–10 min)**: Wash/chop; start preheat.
2. **Start base (10–20 min)**: Begin carbs or aromatics.
3. **Cook protein/veg (20–35 min)**: Add in order of cook time.
4. **Finish (35–45 min)**: Sauce, seasoning, texture check.
5. **Serve & store (45–50 min)**: Plate; cool leftovers quickly.

## Food Safety Gate

- **Chicken/turkey**: 165°F / 74°C internal
- **Ground meats**: 160°F / 71°C
- **Fish**: Flakes, 145°F / 63°C
- **Leftovers**: Refrigerate within 2 hours (1 hour if hot room)

---

## Rescue Paths

- **Too salty**: Add acid (lemon/vinegar), dilute with veg/broth, or add starch.
- **Too bland**: Add salt, acid, or umami (soy, cheese, tomato).
- **Too thick**: Add water or broth.
- **Too thin**: Simmer longer or add starch slurry.
- **Overcooked veg**: Turn into soup or blend into sauce.
