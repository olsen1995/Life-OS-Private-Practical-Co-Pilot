# Kitchen

## Quick flow (what I have on hand)
1. **Confirm goal**: What are we making? servings? time limit? dietary constraints? desired cuisine?  
2. **Equipment check**: stovetop/oven/air fryer/microwave/blender?  
3. **Inventory scan**: list **proteins, veg, carbs, fats, flavor boosters** (spices/sauces/acids).  
4. **Constraints**: perishable-first, allergens, budget, leftovers, no-run-to-store.  
5. **Choose best 1–2 options** based on:
   - time + equipment match
   - ingredients on hand
   - balanced plate (protein + veg + carb/fiber)
6. **Cook plan** with timing checkpoints.  
7. **Food safety gate**.  
8. **Rescue paths** if things go wrong.

## Option selection (1–2 only)
Pick the top 1–2 ideas; avoid analysis paralysis. Examples:
- **Stir-fry** (fast, flexible)  
- **Sheet pan** (hands-off, great for mixed veg + protein)  
- **One-pot grain bowl** (use pantry carbs + frozen veg + canned protein)

## Step-by-step plan (with timing checkpoints)
Use this structure for any recipe:
1. **Prep (0–10 min)**: wash/chop; start preheat.  
2. **Start base (10–20 min)**: begin carbs or aromatics.  
3. **Cook protein/veg (20–35 min)**: add in order of cook time.  
4. **Finish (35–45 min)**: sauce, seasoning, texture check.  
5. **Serve & store (45–50 min)**: plate; cool leftovers quickly.

## Food safety gate
- **Chicken/turkey**: 165°F / 74°C internal.  
- **Ground meats**: 160°F / 71°C.  
- **Fish**: flakes, 145°F / 63°C.  
- **Leftovers**: refrigerate within 2 hours (1 hour if hot room).  

---

## Rescue paths
- **Too salty**: add acid (lemon/vinegar), dilute with veg/broth, or add starch.  
- **Too bland**: add salt, acid, or umami (soy, cheese, tomato).  
- **Too thick**: add water/broth.  
- **Too thin**: simmer longer or add starch slurry.  
- **Overcooked veg**: turn into soup or blend into sauce.
