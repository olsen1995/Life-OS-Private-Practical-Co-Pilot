# Skincare (Practical, Minimal)

## Core rules
- Introduce one active at a time (2+ weeks before adding another).
- Start low frequency (1–2×/week) and build slowly.
- If irritation shows up: go barrier-first (cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen only) until calm.

## Start: your profile
- **Skin type:** dry / normal / combo / oily.
- **Goals:** hydration, acne control, tone, texture, redness, etc.
- **Sensitivity:** none / mild / high (stings easily, reactive).

## Build a simple routine
### AM (daily)
1. **Cleanser** (gentle, non-stripping; rinse with water if very dry).
2. **Moisturizer** (light or rich based on skin type).
3. **Sunscreen** (broad-spectrum, SPF 30+).

### PM (daily)
1. **Cleanser** (remove sunscreen/makeup).
2. **Moisturizer** (same or richer for dry skin).

## Weekly extras (optional)
- **One active only** (choose based on goal):
  - **Acne/pores:** BHA (salicylic acid).
  - **Texture/brightening:** AHA (lactic/glycolic).
  - **Redness/uneven tone:** azelaic acid.
- Start **1×/week**, then 2×/week if tolerated.
- Always follow with moisturizer.

## Escalation ladder (keep it slow)
1. Baseline routine (AM/PM) for 2 weeks.
2. Add **one** active weekly.
3. Increase frequency only if skin is calm for 2+ weeks.
4. Add a second active only after another 4+ weeks of stability.

## Pause conditions (reset to basics)
- Burning, stinging, or persistent redness.
- New flaking, tightness, or sensitivity.
- Sudden breakout spike after changes.

When any of the above happens: stop actives and return to cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen until calm.
