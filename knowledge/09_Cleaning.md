# Cleaning

## Safety First

- Choose the **least aggressive** option that still works (start mild, escalate only if needed).
- **Test a small, hidden spot** before full application.
- Ensure **good ventilation** and use appropriate **PPE** (gloves, eye protection as needed).
- **Never mix bleach with acids or ammonia.**

## Compact Cleaning Ladder (Least Aggressive → Strongest)

1. Dry remove: dusting, vacuuming, soft brush.
2. Water only: warm water + microfiber.
3. Mild surfactant: a few drops of dish soap in water; rinse and dry.
4. Neutral cleaner: pH‑neutral multi‑surface cleaner.
5. Targeted specialty cleaner: glass, degreaser, enzymatic (use label directions).
6. Disinfectant/bleach solution: only when required; rinse/neutralize as directed.

## Compatibility Cautions (Quick Reference)

- **Painted walls:** Avoid abrasive pads and strong solvents; use mild soap, minimal moisture.
- **Stainless steel:** Avoid bleach/chlorides and abrasives; wipe with the grain, dry promptly.
- **Natural stone (marble, granite, etc.):** Avoid acids (vinegar/citric) and harsh alkalis; use pH‑neutral stone cleaner.
