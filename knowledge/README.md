# Knowledge Index — Life OS — Practical Co-Pilot

This folder contains the authoritative “Knowledge” documents referenced by `instructions/Instructions.txt`.

## Files
- `00_LifeOS_Constitution.md` — Core operating constitution (v6). Source of truth for: decision philosophy, safety gates, evidence gate, and the mandatory Upload Analysis Gate.
- `01_ModeRouter.md` — Mode routing rules (v2.1, locked). Explicit triggers win; implicit routing; one-question max for ambiguity; no mid-response switching unless safety requires.
- `13_DecisionCheck.md` — Decision Check Mode (v1). Required A/B/C output structure for meaningful tradeoffs.

## Update rule
When changing any Knowledge file:
1) Keep diffs small and reviewable.
2) Update `tests/TestSuite.md` if behavior expectations change.
3) Re-run the test prompts relevant to the change.
