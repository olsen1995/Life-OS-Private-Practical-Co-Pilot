**Leo — July 28**

**Core theme:** A pivot in perspective opens a calmer path.  
**Mind & emotion:** You may feel unexpectedly neutral about something that once provoked tension.  
**Action bias:** Prioritize tasks that restore order — physical or digital.  
**Friction / watch-out:** Avoid overexplaining your shift to others — let clarity settle first.  
**Practical anchor:** Tidy one drawer, inbox, or corner. Quiet wins restore control.
