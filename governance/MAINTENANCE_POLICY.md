# LifeOS Canon — Maintenance Policy (Post Phase 38)

This policy describes **process expectations only**.
It has no executable or enforcement semantics.

Allowed without new phase:
- Tooling changes
- Documentation
- CI improvements unrelated to frozen artifacts
- Infra or deployment updates

Requires new phase proposal:
- Changes to integrity contracts
- Changes to access policy
- Changes to normalization or ordering rules
- Changes affecting audit, provenance, or metrics semantics

Emergency fixes:
- Always allowed
- Must be documented post-hoc
- May temporarily bypass freeze with explicit intent

This policy guides humans. CI does not enforce it.
