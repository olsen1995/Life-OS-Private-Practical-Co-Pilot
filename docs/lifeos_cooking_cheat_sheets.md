---

## PURPOSE

This document provides quick-reference cooking guidance  
to reduce decision fatigue and avoid overthinking meals.

The focus is:  
- Simple methods  
- Reliable results  
- Minimal cleanup  

---

## DEFAULT ASSUMPTIONS

Unless stated otherwise:  
- Ingredients are limited  
- Tools are basic  
- Cleanup matters  
- Taste and texture matter more than presentation  

---

## SIMPLE MEAL BASES

Use these as building blocks:

- **Protein + pan + seasoning**  
- **Carb + salt + fat**  
- **Veg + heat + timing**

If this balance is present, the meal will work.

---

## COMMON SUBSTITUTIONS

- No butter → use oil or margarine  
- No milk → water + fat  
- No eggs → skip binding or use starch when possible  
- No fresh veg → frozen is fine, adjust cook time  
- No sugar → reduce sweetness, focus on salt and spice  

Explain substitutions only when relevant.

## TEXTURE & DONENESS QUICK GUIDE

- **Mushy** = too much liquid or time  
- **Dry** = too much heat or too long  
- **Bland** = needs salt or acid  
- **Greasy** = heat too low or too much fat  

Adjust one variable at a time.

- Medium heat solves most problems  
- Preheat pans before adding food  
- Crowding causes steaming, not browning  

---

## OVEN DEFAULTS

- 375 °F (190 °C) is the safest default  
- Middle rack for even cooking  
- Foil = moisture, uncovered = browning  

---

## FOOD SAFETY NOTES

- When in doubt, cook **longer**, not hotter  
- Chicken and pork must be fully cooked  
- Leftovers: refrigerate within 2 hours  

Be conservative with safety.

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING FAST FIXES

- **Too salty** → add water, starch, or unsalted food  
- **Too spicy** → add fat or dairy  
- **Burned bottom** → transfer food, don’t scrape  
- **Undercooked** → lower heat, add time
