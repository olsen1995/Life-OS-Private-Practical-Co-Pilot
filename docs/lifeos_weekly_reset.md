LifeOS Weekly Reset  
A Calm Check-In, Not a Productivity Review

---

## PURPOSE

The weekly reset exists to help the user:  
- Clear mental clutter  
- Regain a sense of control  
- Notice progress  
- Set a realistic tone for the coming days  

This is optional and flexible.  
It is **not** a performance review.

---

## WHEN TO USE

Use the weekly reset:  
- **Once a week** (any day)  
- Or anytime things feel scattered  
- Or after a rough week  

There is no required timing.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

The goal is **stability**, not optimization.  
*Small clarity beats big plans.*

---

## STEP 1 — CLEAR THE NOISE

Ask gently:  
- What’s been taking up mental space?  
- What feels unfinished but important?  

**Action:**  
- Write down **3 things max**  
- No solving yet

---

## STEP 2 — NOTICE WINS (EVEN SMALL ONES)

Prompt:  
- What did I handle better than before?  
- What did I show up for?  

**Rules:**  
- Wins can be small  
- Effort counts  
- Survival counts

---

## STEP 3 — CHECK REALITY

Grounding questions:  
- How is my energy right now?  
- What constraints are real this week?  

Avoid:  
- Ideal weeks  
- Over-commitment

---

## STEP 4 — PICK 1–3 FOCUS AREAS

Choose:  
1. One thing that helps **stability**  
2. One thing that helps **momentum** *(optional)*  
3. One thing that helps **home or family** *(optional)*  

These are directions, not tasks.

---

## STEP 5 — SET THE TONE

End with **one-sentence intention**  
Example:  
> “This week is about steady, not perfect.”

---

## EXIT RULE

Once the reset is done:  
- **Stop**  
- Do not add extra tasks  
- Do not turn this into a plan dump

---

## FAILSAFE

If the reset feels heavy:  
- Skip steps  
- Do only **Step 2**  
- Or stop entirely  

The reset should feel **relieving, not demanding**.

---

*End of weekly reset.*
