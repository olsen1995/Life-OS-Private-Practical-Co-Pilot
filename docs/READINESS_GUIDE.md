# Readiness & Simplification Guide
(Human-First Governance Overview)

## Purpose

This document exists to ensure the Life-OS repository remains:
- Understandable to new contributors
- Stable under long-term maintenance
- Governed by clear, consistent language

This is a **readiness pass**, not a policy or enforcement mechanism.

Nothing in this document introduces rules, gates, automation, or authority.

## How to Read This Repository (Entry Point)

If you are new to the system, read in this order:

1. **Operational Mode**
   - Establishes the system’s default posture
   - Defines what “normal” means

2. **Governance Snapshot**
   - Shows the current declared governance state
   - Clarifies Canon authority and freeze awareness

3. **Promotion Pipeline (Draft)**
   - Explains how ideas move conceptually from development to runtime
   - No automation implied

4. **Stability & CI Overview**
   - Helps you understand what CI failures mean (and don’t mean)

This guide exists to reduce tribal knowledge and ambiguity.

## Terminology Normalization

The following terms are used consistently across documentation:

### Canon
- The authoritative, immutable source of structured truth
- Canon is **read-only** unless explicitly released
- Canon does not mutate implicitly

### Snapshot
- A deterministic capture of Canon state
- Used for traceability and reproducibility
- Snapshots are informational unless explicitly enforced elsewhere

### Freeze
- A declared governance state indicating heightened caution
- A freeze does **not** automatically block changes by itself
- Enforcement (if any) is handled elsewhere

### Promotion
- A human decision to elevate Canon or behavior
- Never automatic
- Always intentional and auditable

### Operational Mode
- The default, steady-state posture of the system
- Governance systems assumed active
- No emergency or exceptional conditions

## Redundancy & Simplification Notes

The following principles guide documentation upkeep:

- Explanations should exist **once**, not repeated across files
- Documents should reference concepts, not restate them
- High-level intent belongs in governance docs
- Implementation detail belongs in code or tests

If two documents explain the same concept:
→ One should become authoritative  
→ The other should reference it

---

## Non-Goals (Important)

This system intentionally does NOT:

- Auto-promote Canon
- Auto-upgrade runtime
- Infer intent from changes
- Enforce governance silently
- Replace human judgment

Any assumption otherwise is incorrect.

---

## Human Responsibility Model

Governance in this system is **human-first**:

- Humans declare intent
- Humans review risk
- Humans decide when to freeze, promote, or override
- Automation exists only to surface clarity, not authority

If you are unsure:
→ Pause  
→ Read governance docs  
→ Prefer clarity over speed  

---

## Maintenance Expectations

A readiness pass should be repeated when:
- New governance concepts are introduced
- Documentation grows noticeably
- Confusion or duplication is observed

This document may be updated for clarity,
but must remain **documentation-only**.

---

## Final Note

If something feels unclear or “heavy”:
That is a signal.

The goal of this repository is not control —
it is **trust through clarity**.
