# How to Change This System
(Human-First Meta Guide)

## Purpose

This document explains **how changes to this system SHOULD be approached**, proposed,
and communicated over time.

It exists to:
- Preserve trust
- Reduce accidental governance breakage
- Help future humans (including future-you) make safe, intentional decisions

This guide is **advisory and instructional only**.
It introduces no enforcement, automation, or authority.

---

## 1️⃣ Intent First

Before proposing *any* change, clearly state **why**.

Good change proposals start with:
- The problem being solved
- The motivation behind the change
- The risk if nothing is done

Only after intent is clear should *what* and *how* be discussed.

**Why this matters**
- Intent creates shared understanding
- Intent allows others to assess risk correctly
- Intent makes decisions auditable over time

**Anti-pattern**
- Jumping directly to implementation without context

---

## 2️⃣ Change Class Awareness

Not all changes carry the same risk.

This system uses a **shared language** to reason about change impact:

- **Safe Changes**  
  Documentation, comments, formatting, clarification, or test additions
  with no behavioral implications.

- **Risky Changes**  
  Changes adjacent to Canon, runtime behavior, CI, or governance assumptions.
  These require deliberate review and a slower pace.

- **Forbidden Changes**  
  Changes that violate declared governance boundaries, ignore freezes,
  or bypass integrity assumptions.

This classification is **descriptive**, not automated.
It exists to guide human judgment.

**Rule of thumb**
If you are unsure which class applies → treat the change as Risky.

---

## 3️⃣ Governance Respect

Governance artifacts exist to protect long-term trust.

When proposing changes, be mindful of:

- **Canon immutability**  
  Canon is authoritative by design and should not be treated as casually mutable.

- **Freeze awareness**  
  A freeze signals heightened caution, not panic.
  It is a prompt to slow down and communicate clearly.

- **Promotion mindset**  
  Promotion is intentional and human-driven, never automatic.

Respecting governance does not mean avoiding change —
it means making change *legible* and *deliberate*.

---

## 4️⃣ Human Trust Model

This system assumes **humans remain in control**.

Trust is preserved by:
- Clear communication
- Explicit intent
- Reversible decisions
- Auditable history

No single change should require “tribal knowledge” to understand later.

If a future reader cannot answer:
> “Why was this done?”

Then the change was under-documented.

---

## 5️⃣ Non-Goals

This system is **not** trying to:

- Fully automate governance
- Replace human judgment
- Prevent all mistakes
- Encode every rule in CI or code

Some ambiguity is intentional.
Some decisions must remain human.

The goal is **clarity**, not control.

---

## Final Note

When in doubt:
- Pause
- Write down intent
- Ask whether trust is preserved

A slower, clearer change is always cheaper than repairing broken assumptions later.
